# Full Stack Web Application Starter

This is a starter template for a full stack web application built with Node.js,
Express, and SQLite. It is fully containerized using Docker, making it easy to
deploy to various environments, including AWS EC2 instances.

This project includes documentation and scripts for setting up, configuring, and
deploying the application and is used by students in multiple courses. Please
reference the assigned course materials for specific instructions on how to use
this project in your coursework. Your project may not require all features
included in this template.

## Deployment

The preferred deployment method for this application is using Docker. Detailed
instructions for deploying the application to an AWS EC2 instance using Docker
are provided in the [Docker deployment guide](docs/deploy-docker/README.md).

For those interested in manually setting up the application without Docker,
